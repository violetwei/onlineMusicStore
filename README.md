simulate an online Music place in Java with HashTable

### The class MyHashTable has the following fields:

• An int for the number of entries stored inside the table.

• An int for the number of buckets the table has (Note that this value is initialized by the constructor, but could change later on if the number of entries increases).

• A final double representing the load factor for the hash table.

• An ArrayList of buckets used to store the entries to the table. Where each bucket is a
LinkedList of HashPairs.
